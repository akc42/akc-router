`AKC.Route` behavior is *normally* added to two types of custom element:-

1. Those that sit (once the elements have been stamped out into the DOM) as direct children of an
`<iron-pages>` (or derivative) element, or

2. An element controlling a modal dialog.

The behavior defines a `path` property which should be configured on the element to specify which
URLs it will respond to. It should be statically defined because it is only analysed onced by the
router once all the elements have been added to the DOM. Because elements with this behaviour can
be nested, the `path` only maps on to part of the URL.

Each portion of the URL is called a **model** and consists of a "/" followed by a *name* and a
number of values acting as parameters to the model separated with the "/". Actually there is one
other special type of `model` which has the name "/". This may not have any parameters, or
children elements with an `AKC.Route` behavior. It is needed  to sit alongside sibling `AKC.Route`
elements with names, but still have something to display when the URL is missing the model portion
of the.

This `path` attribute should contain a pattern which consists of a series of segments separated by
the "/" character (The initial "/" character is optional, except of course the when it the only
character). The first segment is the "name" of the model. Following the name can be zero or more
segments which start with a "+" character, followed by either "d" or "s". Each one of those
specifies a *definite* parameter, d specifying that it should only consists of digits (0-9) or s
specifying that the parameter should be a string (\w from RegExp). Following definite parameters are
zero or more *optional* ones.  These are specified in a similar way, except that the "-" character
is used instead of the plus. Finally, optionally, there may be an action list.  This is a set of
names separated by ":" characters.  If the first character of the action options is a ":" it means
that the action part of the model is optional (ie the URL may or may not contain it.)

Because of the way the URL to model matching mechanism has to work, there are some constraints on
model and action names.

* Model and Action names are case insensitive and must match the \w (from RegExp) characters. We
recommend only using lowercase characters. The same is true of the parameters after the "+" or "-"
signs, but of course they will not be represented literally in the URLs.

* Because the entire URL is matched in one go, a model name will be matched in preference to an
optional parameter value (assuming no action names). Care must be taken with the overall URL
strategy to avoid such ambiguities.

* An action name will always be matched in preference to an optional parameter
value in a url, For example it would not be a good idea to have a model pattern
'/user/+d/-s/fight:stop' when the second (optional) parameter might be the name
of a sport.

When the element containing this behavior is selected, it will expose the actual
values of its parameters in a `parameters` property. This property will be an Array containing the values in the order specified in the *path*. Only the
values are actually present in the URL will be present in the properties Array.
The element will also expose an `action` property with a string value of the
option used, unless there is no specification, when the `action` property will
be the empty string.

The behaviour defines a read/write `state` Object property with a notify:true flag.  If the URL is
being switched to as a result of the initial start up to this URL, or as a result of being switched
to from another part of the application, the host element is responsible for getting the state based
on the `parameters`.  Since this is likely to be an asynchronous option, the `AKC.Route` module asks
the host element to get the state by calling an abstract routine called `_routeChange` from within a
Promise, with two (resolve and reject) callbacks.

A successful resolution will provide `AKC.Route` back with the state, which is then exposed on the
property, but perhaps more importantly, co-ordinates with the other elements also involved with this
URL so that the state can be passed back to the browsers history.  The reject option expects a new
URL to switch to.  This can be used if invalid parameters have been passed in a URL and the element
wants to redirect to somewhere to tell the user.

If the user switches to the URL through the back or forward button on the browser, any previously
saved state will seperated out from the other models and put back to the property. At that point the
behavior will call another abstract function, `_replayURL` which the host element can use (if it
needs to) to do any other operations it would normally undertake once the state had been aquired.

Elements may optionally include a `dialog` property.  When it does, it tells the router to exclude
this element from the list of elements to *select* when deciding what value to put out on the
`selected` attribute.  It's index will still be counted from the start of the level, so don't embed
one as a direct child of an `iron-pages` element.

 This may be included on a page to provide indexing
for its children with `AKC.Route` behaviour.  It invokes a "selected" property which provides
indexing for the `AKC.Route` elements as its children.  It must have valid children (either 1
ordinary route, and one home route, or two or more ordinary routes with an optional home route as
well.  It can also have embedded `<akc-route-selector>` elements.)
